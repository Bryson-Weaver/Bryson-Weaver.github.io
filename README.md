## Introduction

This project is my personal GitHub Pages website, created as part of my web development learning journey.  
It demonstrates skills in **semantic HTML**, **CSS styling**, **responsive design with Flexbox**, and **form handling**.  

The site includes a **homepage**, a **blog page with sample articles**, and a **contact section with a form**.  
Itâ€™s a foundation that I can expand into a portfolio or a personal blog in the future.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)

## Features

- A static **homepage** with clean, responsive design.
- A **blog page** with multiple articles using semantic HTML `<article>` tags.
- A **contact form** with required fields, smooth hover/focus transitions, and a responsive layout.
- Navigation menu with hover effects.
- Mobile-first design with media queries for **phones**, **tablets**, and **desktops**.
- Simple CSS animations (fade-in effect and hover transitions).
